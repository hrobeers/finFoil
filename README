This is the finFoil repository for the Qt/C++ remake (versions > 1.0).


Compilation from source
========================
Note: When compiling in a git clone, first read the section "Compiling in a git clone".
Execute the following commands in a terminal in the finFoil directory:

$ mkdir bin
$ cd bin
$ cmake ..
$ make

After completing the commands listed above, a finFoil executable should be located in the bin (=current) directory.

Compiling in a git clone
========================
When compiling in a git clone, the git submodules should be fetched first.
Do this by executing the following commands in the finfoil directory:

$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update --recursive

After fetching the submodules, continue with section "Compilation from source".

Dependencies
============
C++11 compliant compiler (GCC >= 4.7, Clang >= 3.0, Intel C++ >= 12.1)
cmake >= 2.8.11
Qt >= 5.3
Boost >= 1.55

LICENSE
=======
The majority of the code is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license.
However, parts of the code are licensed under the GNU LGPL version 2.1.
Since Everything is statically linked, the total project inherits the LGPL license.
It should be trivial for every Qt/C++ programmer to extract this code for dynamic linking so that a BSD licensed project is obtained with a dynamic dependency on a LGPL library.

You should have received a copy of the licence agreement for both the 2-clause BSD license and the LGPLv2 license along with this source code bundle.
